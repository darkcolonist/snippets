Raynor
- broken down into "Ray" and "Nor"
- Ray was derived from Manta Ray, which have a behaviour of visiting cleaning stations where small fish such as wrasse, remora and angelfish swim in the manta's gills and over its skin to feed, in the process of cleaning it of parasites and dead tissue. Like other species in the shark family they must swim to keep from sinking, so their stay at a cleaning station is characterized by slow circuits.
- Nor was derived from Norse Mythology popular for their Vikings. Vikings are warriors known to explore and raid.
- Why Raynor? because simply put, its main purpose is to explore, raid and eliminate parasites. --- well, parasites known as scammers.
